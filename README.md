# OOPS Java Programs 

This repository contains Java programs based on Object-Oriented Programming concepts.  
Each folder (`Exercise 1`, `Exercise 2`, etc.) includes solutions to basic Java problems done using Eclipse IDE.

## Folder Structure

- `Exercise 1`  
  - Question 1: Ticket Price Calculator 
  - Question 2: Electricity Usage Tracker  
  - Question 3: ATM Simulation  
  - Question 4: Number Guessing Game  

- `Exercise 2`
  - Question 6: Search a number in an array and count its occurrences  
  - Question 7: Display numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 9
 
- `Exercise 3`  
  - Question 2: Create a program to get a string from user and change all occurrences of its first char to `$`, except the first char itself.  
  - Question 6: Given a string, display the run length encoded string for the given string.

- `Exercise 4`  
- Question 2: Create a `FoodOrder` class with order ID, food item name, price, and quantity, and include a constructor to initialize these details. Add a method to calculate the total bill as `(price × quantity) + ₹50` for delivery charges. Take input for two different orders, create two `FoodOrder` objects, and display the total bill for each order.

- `Exercise 5`
- - **Bank ATM Application using Inheritance and Method Overriding**  
  - Base class: `CashTree`  
  - Subclasses: `SBI_Bank`, `HDFC_Bank`  
  - Features:  
    - View Balance  
    - Withdraw (with service charge)  
    - Deposit (with interest)  
  - Demonstrates the use of constructors, method overriding, and polymorphism.
